What is Route53 & use of it?
---------------------
Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It provides domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking services, allowing you to manage the domain names 
(such as example.com) and route internet traffic to the appropriate resources, such as web servers, load balancers, 
or other AWS services.

Key features and uses of Amazon Route 53 include:
--------------------
Domain Registration: 

You can use Route 53 to register new domain names or transfer existing domain names to be managed within the Route 53 service.

Hosted Zones:

a hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain. 
It's essentially a collection of DNS records that define the mappings between domain names and IP addresses or other 
resources. When you create a hosted zone, you're telling Route 53 how to handle DNS requests for that domain.

Health Checks:

You can set up health checks to monitor the health and availability of your resources, such as web servers or load balancers.
If a resource becomes unhealthy, Route 53 can automatically redirect traffic away from the unhealthy resource.

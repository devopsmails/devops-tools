Software Approaches:
```
Waterfall method:
-----------
Waterfall follows a sequential approach where each phase of the software development lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) is completed one after the other.


![Waterfall-Model](https://github.com/devopsmails/devops-tools/assets/119680288/984fc993-b9ef-41ca-8a48-ef019f2e8d84)


Strengths: 
    Clear requirements, good documentation, predictable outcomes.

Weaknesses: 
    Inflexible, difficult changes, limited feedback loops.
```
Agile Method:
```
Breaks down work into smaller, time-boxed cycles called "sprints" (typically 1-4 weeks). Teams work on features in each sprint, gather feedback, and adapt based on learnings.

Strengths: 
    Adaptable to changing requirements, promotes continuous improvement, and emphasizes collaboration and communication.

Weaknesses: 
    Requires strong communication and planning, may not be suitable for projects with strict deadlines or complex dependencies.

DevOps Method?
----------
```
DevOps is a Culture and practice that promotes collaboration between development (Dev), operations (Ops), and security (Sec) teams
Aims to break down silos and streamline the software development lifecycle, from development and testing to deployment and monitoring.
DevOps  is methodology to make faster High Quality delivery with the disired code Quality parameters, testing, Complete automation and Monitering. 
```
What SDLC?
-----------
```
Software Devlopment Life Cycle

Planning (Requirement Collections)
Defining(Documenting the requirements)
Designing
    HLD(High Level Desigining): What servers or DB's are required.
    LLD(Low Level Desigining): What feature module ..

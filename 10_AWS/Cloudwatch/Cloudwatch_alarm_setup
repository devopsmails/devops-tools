Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time.
You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.
Key features:
  Monitering
  alerting
  reporting
  logging

Advantages:
  Monitering
  Real-life Metrics(API calls in 1 minute, CPU Utilization in last 30 minutes, Memory status)
  alerts
  log-sights
  Custom Metrics
  Cost Optimization
  Scaling

=====================
Dash Board:
=====================
We can a dash board any tipe of metrics
Create dash board: number>>
select the service : EX:EC2 >> per-instance >> select the instance & metrics we just want to see the overview >>

select the metrics we want to see: To check the cpu utilization or so .. metrics "Graphically"
Graphed metrics:
    ----------
  We can customize of graph as bar or pie or number ..
  we can take Avarage for a minute in real time.
===========
Alarms:(Sends to notifications via mail or SMS.. to take an action if configured limit is reached)
=========
Cloud watch dashboard >> Alarms >> in alarms >> create alarm >> Select metrics >>

ctrl + f: instance-name or with id>> Select metrics>>:
  Metric name: CPUUtilization(For what metric i want to get the alarm)
InstanceId: ###
Instance name: ###
realtime: Statistic: Average
          period: 1
Threshold type: Static
Whenever CPUUtilization is...:   Greater/Equal
than…: 50(number of percentage) >> Click Next
     -----------
Alarm state trigger: in alarm
Send a notification to the following SNS topic: Select existing SNS topic or create new >>
    topic-name: Ex; DevOps-CPU-Utilizations
    Email endpoints that will receive the notification…: ##recpient mail address#

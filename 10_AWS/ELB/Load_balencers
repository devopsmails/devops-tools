What is Load Balencer? = Trafic Routing
=======================

/ A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and 
routing client requests across all servers capable
of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and 
capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. \

What is OSI Layers? = Layers in Trafic Routing
========================

This model is called Open System Interconnection (OSI) 
because this model allows any two different systems to communicate regardless of their underlying architecture.

Advantages of OSI Model
--------------
Determine the required hardware and software to build their network. 
Understand and communicate the process followed by components communicating across a network. 
Perform troubleshooting,by identifying which network layer is causing an issue and focusing efforts on that layer.

ALB  vs NLB VS GWLB

==================
ALB (Application Load Balancer), NLB (Network Load Balancer), and GWLB (Gateway Load Balancer) 
are different types of load balancers offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Each has specific use cases based on your application's requirements.
Here's a brief overview of when to use each type:

**ALB (Application Load Balancer):**====hIGH COST===========

Use ALB when you have multiple HTTP/HTTPS applications running on different port numbers or 
instances and need to distribute incoming traffic based on application layer information 
(such as URL paths, hostnames, or HTTP headers). ALB is well-suited for routing requests to microservices and containers.

Use Cases:
- Routing requests to different backend services based on URL paths or hostnames.
- Load balancing traffic for containerized applications.
- Providing support for multiple domains with SSL/TLS termination.

**NLB (Network Load Balancer):**==========LOW COST===========

Use NLB when you need to handle TCP/UDP traffic at the transport layer and require high performance, 
low latency, and the ability to handle millions of requests per second. 
NLB is ideal for situations where you need to maintain the source IP address of the client.

Use Cases:
- Distributing traffic to instances for gaming applications or IoT devices.
- Handling TCP/UDP traffic where source IP preservation is important.
- Forwarding traffic directly to instances without modifying the request.

**GWLB (Gateway Load Balancer):**

Use GWLB when you have multiple Amazon VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) and need to route traffic between them. 
GWLB is designed to route traffic at the network layer (IP protocol) and can handle high throughput.

Use Cases:
- Load balancing traffic between multiple VPCs.
- Distributing traffic across VPCs in a regional or cross-regional setup.
- Routing traffic between VPCs using IP protocol-based rules.

What is Public Cloud?
=====================
A public cloud is a type of cloud computing service model that provides computing resources, 
such as virtual machines, storage, networking, and applications, over the internet to multiple customers. 
In a public cloud, these resources are hosted and managed by a third-party cloud service provider, 
such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or others. 
These providers offer their infrastructure and services to organizations and individuals on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis.

Key characteristics of a public cloud include:

Shared Resources
Scalability
Self-Service Provisioning
Pay-as-You-Go Billing
Global Reach
Managed Services
Accessibility

What is Private Cloud?
================
A private cloud is a type of cloud computing environment that is dedicated to a single organization or business entity.
Unlike a public cloud, where resources are shared among multiple customers, a private cloud is designed to
provide computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, exclusively to the organization that 
owns and manages it. Private clouds offer many of the same benefits as public clouds,such as scalability and 
self-service provisioning, but they are deployed within an organization's own data centers or hosted in a third-party
data center.

Key characteristics of a private cloud include:

Dedicated Resources

Enhanced Security and Control

Customization

Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

Performance and Latency

Isolation

initial Costly and Resource Management

GitOps: Declarative DevOps with Git at the Core
What is GitOps?
```
GitOps is a software development and deployment methodology that uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for deploying and managing applications. 
It allows you to define the desired state of your application infrastructure and configurations in Git repositories, and then uses tools like Argo CD to automatically apply those changes to your target environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).
```

Key Features of GitOps:

```
Declarative: 
    You define what you want your system to look like, not how to get there. Argo CD takes care of the rest.

Git as the source of truth: 
    All configurations and infrastructure definitions are stored in Git repositories, providing version control, auditability, and collaboration.

Automated deployments: 
    Changes in the Git repository automatically trigger deployments, promoting consistency and reducing manual intervention.

Rollback capabilities: 
    Easy to roll back to previous versions by reverting changes in Git.

Continuous delivery: 
    Enables a seamless flow of changes from development to production.

Continuous reconciled:
    conitnout monitering for changes on github or kubernetes(Targets)
```

Advantages of GitOps:
```
Reduced risk: 
    Automatic deployments and rollbacks minimize human error and potential issues.

Increased productivity: 
    Developers can focus on writing code instead of managing deployments.

Improved security: 
    Configuration changes are tracked and audited in Git, enhancing security posture.

Scalability: 
    Handles small and large deployments with ease.
    
Collaboration: 
    Easy collaboration between developers and operations teams through Git.

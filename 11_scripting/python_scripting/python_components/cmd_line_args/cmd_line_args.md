Command line arguments ?

```
Command-line arguments are a powerful tool for providing input to programs from the outside, without needing to edit the code itself.
They act like additional instructions or parameters that customize the program's execution. 

EX: aws s3 ls 
aws = programme
s3 ls = input arguments to aws programme 
```

***sys*** module helps to provide the command line args
***sys module is an in built module which alredy installed along with python bundle***
